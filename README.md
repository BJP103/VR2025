Virtual Reality Project for Fall 2025

# Intro

This project is based on the popular game Peak. This game is a co-op multiplayer game with the objective of climbing mountains using stamina and items. The game requires team work to advance in the game. 

# Mechanics

The player must ascend the mountain with their own might and their friends , using their stamina and not die. 

# Dynamics


# Aethethetics

The game has a 3D cartoon aethethetic. The grapics are simple but game feels very big or inifinite at times. The moutains are bigger than the game will render at times, so it feels there is not top to the moutains. This makes so grand while being so simple looking.
